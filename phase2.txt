How to use application: 

when you load the website, you will be greeted by the home page which has the sections: about, team, and UI screenshots to show ease of use. At the top there is a navbar which allows you to go to the register page or the login page.

once at the register page, you will be asked to enter your infomation: first name, lastname, phone number, email, username, password and confirm password. if any of the input fields are mistyped, mismatched, user already exists or any other issue, the issues will be reported back to the user once they click enter. 

on succussful registration, you will be asked to enter your credentials and login. 
If you are already a user, click the login button from the navbar and you can login. 

once at the login page, you will be asked to enter your username and password, if the username and password do not match the account or if the username does not exist then an error message will be displayed to the user. 

On successful login, for a non admin user. you will see your information that you entered during registration. from this page you can change your information and on update this change will be persisted to the database. all fields except for username are changable. 

from the /users/logged page the navbar has the following three sections: search rides, create rides, your rides. 

Search rides:
from this page you will be greeted with a google map of GTA, and you can enter your starting point and destination point. Both starting and destination point inputs have auto fill using the Google API. Once both points are set, the map will show the route between A to B on the map. along with the distance in kilometers and the total ride duration in minutes. The user can now select the number of rides they need and click, 'view available rides'.

once the user has clicked view available rides, the app will direct you to /rides/view. which will display which route you have selected and how many passengers. this page also displays the currently joined and the available rides. currently joined are rides, that you have currently joined and available rides are all other rides in the area of your choosing. in the available rides section, you can see the number of available seats, name of ride owner, phone number, time when uber/ cab is called, distance from your origin and distance from your destination. If this is a ride you want to share, then click join, and you will be immediately joined into their ride and this will be seen as their user card jumps from avaiable rides to currently joined. if you wish to leave the ride you can do that as well. 

Create a ride:
if the user wishes to create a ride then again the page is similar to the search for the where you can see the map and the start and end points are reflected back to the user by the map. For creating a ride, the user also needs to add the date and time for their ride, the choice of uberX, uberXL or uberpool and the total number of seats. once the start and end points are entered the distance and the cost will be shown on the page. once the other fields are entered and selected the user can click create and their ride is now stored in the database and other users can see their post. you will be redirected to the 'your rides' page where you can see your post and remove if you no longer need the service.

from all the rides pages, you can go back to your profile page and change your profile information if need be. From any page, you can logout and your session will be deleted.

If the user is an Admin user:
once the admin user is logged in, the admin can see users of the system and delete them if they wish to do so. all deleted users are taken off the system/ database and can no longer login or create/join rides.
